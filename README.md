Reflection:

I was able to complete the following:

        - correct semantics
        - CSS absolute positioning
        - flexbox and responsive layout
        - image elements and file paths correctly applied

    Stretch goals:

        - back to top button
        - internal links
        - hover effects
        - social media links
        - audio track (in JS)

making sure everything would fit the page design that I wanted to follow through with was a little bit difficult; I didn't know how to shrink images to allow for divs or nav sections to be smaller if the user shrunk their browser window.

I believe that the images that I used in the end allowed for the UX to be a little better than when I was struggling with sizing. Solution here being a fixed min px and fixed header and footer to enforce a UI scroll, purposefully avoiding a wrap on the 'episodes section'. This did preclude me from having an static footer akin to the tomatotime example, at the time I wasn't sure how I could keep the full footer length with the window being resized, it would only be the length of the window due to having width set to 100% but I found that I could simply retain the length my using min-width at 100% and the max-width at 100%. I chose to keep the fixed footer as this was more aesthetically pleasing imo.

to be honest assignments make me go into panic mode so I struggled to recall everything that was learned from the sessions.

a big struggle of mine is that I over complicate everything becuase I find it difficult to come up with a structure based plan to follow; I think I would appreciate some help with approaching projects, so how best to do a wire frame and how best to plan out the actual coding also.

even considering a design was difficult because I don't have that kind of creative brain, so this sort of project will continue to be difficult for that purpose. I have no real grasp on the 'design' aspect of development, so even thinking of something took me a couple hours.

I struggled making sure that the links would wrap and fit nicely into the window
